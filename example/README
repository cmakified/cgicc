README for skeleton CGI using GNU Cgicc
=======================================

This directory contains skeleton code and a supporting Makefile for a
CGI application using Cgicc, tailored to the installation environment.

If you are using Solaris or an SVR4-style Unix, you'll need to uncomment
line 59 in the Makefile, and comment out (using '#') line 56.  This is
due to the different methods of embedding a runtime search path on
different flavors of Unix.
