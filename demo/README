GNU cgicc Demo Programs
=======================

There are three demo applications in this directory:

  'test.cgi', a demo of how to access various kinds of submitted form
   information using cgicc.  Use the file 'test.html' to submit data
   to this application.

  'upload.cgi', a demo of how to use cgicc to process uploaded
   files.  Use the file 'upload.html' to submit data to this
   application.

  'dns.cgi', a demo of a web dns gateway.  There is no html file
   associated with this application; it is run directly.

To run the demo applications 'test.cgi' or 'upload.cgi', the associated
html file ('test.html' or 'upload.html') must be configured for your
particular web server.  Scroll down to line 56, which should look like
  <FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://change_this_path/cgi-bin/test.cgi">
in 'test.html', or
  <FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://change_this_path/cgi-bin/upload.cgi">
in 'upload.html'.

Change the path to match your cgi-bin directory.  For example, if you
were running the applications from the /cgi-bin directory on the
server www.gnu.org, the line would contain
ACTION="http://www.gnu.org/cgi-bin/test.cgi".

To run the tests, first copy the 'test.cgi', 'upload.cgi', and
'dns.cgi' applications to the cgi-bin directory (See note on libtool
if this doesn't seem to work).  Ensure that the file permissions are
at least readable and executable by all (-rwxr-xr-w).  Next, copy the
files 'test.html' and 'upload.html' to your HTML directory.  Ensure
that these files are readable by everyone (-rw-r--r--).

To run the applications, point your browser at the 'dns.cgi'
application, or at 'test.html' or 'upload.html'.

Incidentally, to see how transparently cgicc handles the difference
between 'POST' and 'GET' type forms, try changing the request method
in 'test.html' and see what happens.  You won't notice a difference
except in the call to the application.

A Note on libtool
=================

Since cgicc uses libtool to generate the libraries and link against
them, depending on your configuration you may need to use libtool to
copy the applications due to the way runtime search paths are
embedded.  If you are unable to run the applications from the /cgi-bin
directory, use libtool to re-copy them.  From the cgicc/demo
directory, run
  % sh ../libtool --mode=install cp *.cgi cgi-bin/
replacing cgi-bin/ with your webservers cgi-bin directory.

A Note about debug logging
==========================

If you want to use cgicc's debug logging feature in the demos, you'll
need to change the declaration of 'gLogFile' in the source files to
contain a path to the log file. In addition, you need to define the
macro 'DEBUG' during library compilation.  This is accomplished at
configure time, by passing the --enable-debug-logging flag:
  % ./configure --enable-debug-logging [args] 
Finally, the log file must be writable by whichever user your
webserver runs cgi applications under.
