Demo Programs
-------------

If you want to use Cgicc's debug logging feature in the demos, you'll
need to change the declaration of 'gLogFile' to contain a path to the
log file (in addition to defining the macro 'DEBUG' during library
compilation). The log file must be writable by whichever user your web
server runs cgi applications under.

To run the demo application 'test.cgi', the file 'testform.html' must
be configured for your particular web server.  Scroll down until you
see the following line: 

<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://change_this_path/cgi-bin/test.cgi">

Change the path to match 'bindir' as supplied to the 'configure'
script (this is prefix/bin if not explicitly specified). This form
will call the demo 'test.cgi', and will serve as a test of the
installation. Again, note that to use the tests from the web,
'test.cgi' should be in a directory accessible from your web server,
with cgi-bin privileges.

Incidentally, to see how transparently Cgicc handles the difference
between 'POST' and 'GET' type forms, try changing the request method
in 'testform.html' and see what happens.  You won't notice a
difference except in the call to the application.
