GNU cgicc Demo Programs
=======================

There are four demo applications in this directory:

  'test.cgi', a demo of how to access various kinds of submitted form
   information using cgicc.

  'upload.cgi', a demo of how to use cgicc to process uploaded
   files.

  'cookie.cgi', a demo of cgicc's cookie handling ability.

  'dns.cgi', a demo of a web dns gateway.

To run the tests, first copy the 'test.cgi', 'upload.cgi',
'cookie.cgi' and 'dns.cgi' applications to the cgi-bin directory (See
note on libtool if this doesn't seem to work).  Ensure that the file
permissions are at least readable and executable by all (-rwxr-xr-w).

All of these applications are stand-alone; just point your browser at
'test.cgi', 'upload.cgi', 'cookie.cgi', or 'dns.cgi'.

A Note on libtool
=================

Since cgicc uses libtool to generate the libraries and link against
them, depending on your configuration you may need to use libtool to
copy the applications due to the way runtime search paths are
embedded.  If you are unable to run the applications from the /cgi-bin
directory, use libtool to re-copy them.  From the cgicc/demo
directory, run
  % sh ../libtool --mode=install cp *.cgi cgi-bin/
replacing cgi-bin/ with your webservers cgi-bin directory.
