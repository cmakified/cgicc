GNU Cgicc Demo Programs
=======================

To run the demo application 'test.cgi', the file 'testform.html' must
be configured for your particular web server.  Scroll down until you
see the following line (line 47): 

<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://change_this_path/cgi-bin/test.cgi">

Change the path to match your cgi-bin directory.  To run the test,
first copy the 'test.cgi' and 'dns.cgi' applications to the cgi-bin
directory.  Finally, copy 'testform.html' to your HTML directory.

This form will call the demo 'test.cgi', and will serve as a test of
the installation.

Incidentally, to see how transparently Cgicc handles the difference
between 'POST' and 'GET' type forms, try changing the request method
in 'testform.html' and see what happens.  You won't notice a
difference except in the call to the application.


A Note about debug logging
==========================

If you want to use Cgicc's debug logging feature in the demos, you'll
need to change the declaration of 'gLogFile' to contain a path to the
log file (in addition to defining the macro 'DEBUG' during library
compilation). The log file must be writable by whichever user your web
server runs cgi applications under.
