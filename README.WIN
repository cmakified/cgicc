README for using GNU Cgicc on Windows
=====================================

The win/ subdirectory contains Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 workspace and
project files for the cgicc library and test and example applications.


A note about C4251
==================

Please note that when compiling the sample applications, you will
receive several warnings (C4251: 'identifier' : class 'type' needs to
have dll-interface to be used by clients of class 'type2').  This
occurs because Cgicc's classes and functions are exported using the
__declspec method.  Several of Cgicc's functions return the Standard
Template Library class 'string', which is exported in a .DEF file.  At
compile time, the compiler cannot know whether the STL class string is
exported, since Cgicc does not import the .DEF file.
These warnings may be safely ignored.
