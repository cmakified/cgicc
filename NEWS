NEWS - list of user-visible changes between releases of GNU Cgicc

New in 3.0 (1999-05-12):
* Reworked to use the C++ standard template library. 
  In most places, the STL class string is used where bare char* was
  used before. The obsolete classes implementing linked lists are
  gone, replaced by the STL classes vector and iterator. 

* Include files are now installed in the package include directory 
  cgicc/ under the include/ directory, instead of in the
  include/ directory itself.

* Documentation changed to info format, and expanded.

* The test/ directory was renamed to demo/.

* The demo programs are no longer installed.

* The demo programs now contain internal stylesheet information, instead 
  of linking to an external stylesheet.

* Released as part of the GNU project under the GPL.
