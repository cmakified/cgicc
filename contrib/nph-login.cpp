/* 
 * In this example, we will control the HTTPNPH header so that the user
 * will need to provide authentication before the cgi does something.
 * So far, this CGI has only been tested on IIS 5 servers and using
 * browsers IE 5 (Mac OS 9, MacOS X, Windows), Netscape 4.7 (Windows,
 * Linux, Mac), Omniweb 4 (Mac) The ask for user authentication, the
 * cgi issues a 403 http response code.  
 *
 * IMPORTANT: To be able to control the response type HTTP header, the
 * name of the cgi executable needs to start with "nph-". The cgi is
 * then fully responsible for the creation of _ALL_ http headers.
 *
 * IMPORTANT2: Once a valid username/password has been accepted, the
 * browser will send the pair with each request until you quit your
 * browser.  
 *
 * IMPORTANT3: On Windows servers, make certain your webserver is
 * configured to allow basic authentication.
